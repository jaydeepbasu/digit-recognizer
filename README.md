# Digit Recognizer

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms.
Goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten image
In this notebook, we'll explore the popular Digit Recognizer dataset and build an SVM model to classify handwritten digits.

## Data

The data for the following problem is [available on Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer) 
Since the dataset size is large hence it has not been added to the repo, if you want to execute the notebook then please download the dataset from the above mentioned Kaggle link and put it in the data/ directory.

## Pre-requisites

The project was developed using python 3.8.3 with the following packages.
- Pandas
- Numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- statsmodels
